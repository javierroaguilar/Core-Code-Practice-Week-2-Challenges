# Core-Code-Practice-Sessions-2-Challenges

## Challenge 1 - Logic Problem

    Alice - Nobody studied
    Bob - 1 studied
    Charlie - 2 studied
    Dan - 3 studied
    Eva - 4 studied
    
    If Alice tells the truth, and nobody studied, that means she did study. So that could not be possible 
    If Bob is telling the truth, he did studied, and that means 1 person studied. 
    If Charlie tells the truth, then he did studied but someone else has to study too, and that would mean that someone else has to tell the truth also. But if someone else is telling the truth then the Charlie's statement wouldn't be logical. By definition the next statements wouldn't be logical either. 
    Bob is the one that is telling the truth.
